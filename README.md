# portfolio

This is my web development portfolio. This page is a clear and concise way rospective to showcase my projects. Prospective clients and employers will always need an efficient means to view projects and assess a developers skill set, and this page  fulfills that need. Furthermore, this portfolio can be viewed on devices of different sizes, adding convenience to the viewer.

Building this page has expanded my Flexbox skills, as well as honing my HTML & CSS skills.
